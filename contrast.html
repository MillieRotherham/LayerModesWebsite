            <!--Explains what layer modes in this catagory do-->
            <h2>What are Contrast Modes?</h2>
            <p>All of the layer modes in the contrast group work by darkening the dark colours and making the lights lighter. 
                This is done by a combination of techniques from both lightening and darkening techniques.
                They check if they are brighter than 50% grey, and if brighter apply the brighten technique, if darker the darken technique.
            </p>

            <!--Overlay layer explained-->
            <h2>Overlay</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="C:\Users\milli\OneDrive\Documents\Layer Modes Explained\Images\overlayDiagram.png" alt="Example of overlay layer in use">
                <p>This layer mode will apply the screen effect if the pixels are lighter, and the multiply layer effect if the pixels are darker. 
                    Any midtones will become transparent.
                    This is done at half strength so the final result is not as strong as the individual layers themselves.
                    This means the the top colour overlays the bottom, while keeping the shadows and highlights of the lower layer. 
                    The base colour is mixed with the top colour, blending the colours of the two. 
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!--Soft Light layer explained-->
            <h2>Soft Light</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\softLightDiagram.png" alt="Example of soft light layer in use">
                <p>Soft light will use the dodge layer effect if the pixels are lighter, and a burn effect if they are darker.
                    This means that they produce an effect similar to colour or linear burn on the darker colours.
                    Likewise, effects similar to the layer modes with dodge in the title in the Lighten catagory.
                    This causes a much softer and organic effect than overlay, with transperent highlights and shadows. 
                    It's great for adding soft effects with the top colour mixing with the lower to a lesser degree than overlay.
                    If the top layer is soild white or black the final will be lightened or darkened to a degree.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!--Hard Light layer explained-->
            <h2>Hard Light</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\hardLightDiagram.png" alt="Example of hard light layer in use">
                <p>Uses a mix of the multiply on the darker pixels and screen on the lighter pixels. 
                    The effect this produces is more intense than the overlay, with stronger highlights and shadows, 
                    an effect similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the image.
                    It increases both the contrast and saturation. 
                    If the top layer is black, so will the final image. If it is white the final image will also be white. 
                    This layer mode is very similar to Vivid Light, however it does not make the light colours quite as bright and the darks quite as dark.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Vivid Light layer explained-->
            <h2>Vivid Light</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\vividLightDiagram.png" alt="Example of Vivid Light layer in use">
                <p> This layer mode will colour burn or colour dodge the colors depending on if they are lighter or darker than 50% grey.
                    If they are lighter, the burn method is applied, if darker the dodge method. 
                    This layer mode has the most contrast out of Hard, Vivid and Linear Light. 
                    It causes darker shadows and lighter highlights than the other two layer modes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Linear Light layer explained-->
            <h2>Linear Light</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\linearLightDiagram.png" alt="Example of linear light layer in use">
                <p>Linear burn does the same as Vivid Light, applying the Linear Burn layer technique if the colour is lighter than half grey, 
                    and the Linear Dodge effect if it is darker. 
                    The effect that this gives is a little more saturated than Vivid Light and Hard Light. 
                    As can be seen on the example, the darker colours of the trees are a good example of how much more saturated the layer mode is. 
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!--Pin Light layer explained-->
            <h2>Pin Light</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\pinLightDiagram.png" alt="Example of pin light layer in use">
                <p>This layer mode uses the Lighten blend mode on the lighter colours and Darken on the darker colours. 
                    If the top are lighter than 50% grey, pixels that are darker than the blend colour are replaced and visa versa.
                    It is useful for adding things like special effects to images.
                    Pin Light can result in large blocks of colour or noise, and it completely removes all mid-tones which can give some interesting effects.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Hard Mix layer explained-->
            <h2>Hard Mix</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\hardMixDiagram.png" alt="Example of Hard Mix layer in use">
                <p>Hard Mix when applied will add the red, green and blue colour values of the top color to the RGB values of the base color.
                    This basically means that it turns the colours into several different ones those being red, yellow, green, blue, cyan, magenta, or black and white. 
                    Why the sea is not blue in the example is because it also mixes the top and original layers, and the result colour is closer to yellow than blue. 
                    This makes an extremely flat saturated effect, not unlike a poster.
