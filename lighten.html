            <!--Explains what layer modes in this catagory do-->
            <h2>What are Lighten Modes?</h2>
            <p>Lighten layer modes do what they say, lightening the base image in different ways. 
                They are often used to add highlights or lighten the whole image.                 
            </p>
            
            <!--Screen layer explained-->
            <h2>Screen</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\screenDiagram.png" alt="Example of screen layer in use">
                <p>This is the most commonly used layer mode to lighten images. 
                    How it works is by multiplying the inverse of the two layers, which is the opposite of multiply.
                    The result image is always lighter, because it is multipying the light pixels instead of the darker. 
                    Screening with black will produce no difference, and if the top layer is white the final image will be as well.
                    This mode is good for erasing any blacks while keeping the whites, and also making glow effects. 
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!--Add layer explained-->
            <h2>Add / Linear Dodge</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\addDiagram.png" alt="Example of add layer in use">
                <p>This layer mode can be call Add or Linear Dodge, it will depend on the program you're using. It is going to be called Add here.
                    Add works by brightening the base colour to reflect the top colour by increasing the brightness. 
                    It 'Adds' the luminince levels (how bright and dark parts of the image are).
                    It is brighter than Colour Dodge but less intense and saturated.
                    Blending with black produces no difference. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Add Glow layer explained-->
            <h2>Add (Glow)</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\addGlowDiagram.png" alt="Example of Add (Glow) layer in use">
                <p>This layer works like the Add layer, increasing the brightness of colours by adding the colours of the blend layer to the base layer. 
                    This creates a stronger effect than the normal Add colour mode. 
                    As can be seen in the example, Add Glow has less shadows and more vibrant midtones than the normal Add / Linear Dodge. 
                    It is more effective in semi transperent areas, which is not something shown in this example. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Colour Dodge layer explained-->
            <h2>Colour Dodge</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\colourDodgeDiagram.png" alt="Example of colour dodge layer in use">
                <p>To lighten images this layer mode brightens the base layer to relect the blend colour. 
                    It does this by decreasing the contrast between the two layers. 
                    This results in saturated mid tones, as can be seen on the land of the example. 
                    It is one of the lighten modes that produces the most saturation, however it has more pronounced shadows than Glow Dodge. 
                    If the top layer is black there will be no change to the bottom image. 

                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Glow Dodge layer explained-->
            <h2>Glow Dodge</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\glowDodgeDiagram.png" alt="Example of glow dodge layer in use">
                <p>It both lightens the base image and decreases the contrast, which creates very saturated mid tones and extremely bright highlights.
                    This layer mode has the most vibrant colours, and it does not preserve the shadows of the image like colour dodge does,
                    instead making them very saturated as can be seen in the example. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Lighten layer explained-->
            <h2>Lighten</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\lightenDiagram.png" alt="Example of lighten layer in use">
                <p>Lighten compares all of the colour values seperatly and choses the lightest. 
                    It picks the lighter colours of the two layers, replacing darker colours. 
                    Because it looks at all of the colour values seperately, this means that is will create a third colour occasionally unlike Lighter Colour.
                    As you can see in the example image it produces a less harsh transition between colours than Lighter Colour.
                    It is functionally the opposite of Darken, choosing lighter instead of darker colours. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Lighter colour layer explained-->
            <h2>Lighter colour</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\lighterColourDiagram.png" alt="Example of lighter colour layer in use">
                <p> This layer mode compares the total of all values for the blend and base color and displays the higher value color.
                    It creates sharp edges with the replacement, and no third colour unlike Lighten. 
                    This is because it looks at all of the colour values as a whole, and not as individual colours. 
                    This is effectively the opposite of the darker colour layer mode, and it can be used for similar things, 
                    like replacing large blocks of colour with a lighter colour.
