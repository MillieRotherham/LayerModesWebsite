            <h2>How do layers work?</h2>
            <div class="layers-explained-content">
                <img src="Images\layerDiagram.png" alt="Image explaining how layers work">
                <p>
                    Layers are like different pieces of art on the same drawing. They are stacked on top of each other and what you do on one layer will not affect what is
                    happening on the other layer. 
                    <br><br>
                    When you change the layer mode you change how the layer interacts with the one below it. 
                    The effect that it will have on the layer below it depends on the layer mode, which is why it is a good idea to learn about them.
                    Most artists use layer modes for various effects including adding shadows, light, glow and special effects to their art.  
                    It is imortant to note that to be effective, the layer that has a blend mode assigned to it will need to be above the layers it is affecting.

            <!--Explains where to change the layers on the most common art programs-->
            <h2>Where can I change the layers?</h2>
            <div class="layers-changing-content">
                <div class="program-examples">
                    <img src="Images\photoshopLayers.png" alt="Image showing where the layers are on Photoshop">
                    <img src="Images\kritaLayers.png" alt="Image showing where the layers are on krita">
                    <img src="Images\clipStudioPaintLayers.png" alt="Image showing where layers are on Clip Studio Paint">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Where the layers can be found is often the same for most digital art programs - they tend to be found in a small window somewhere on the side of the page, 
                    often on the bottom right. To change a layer mode, click on a layer, and at the top of the small window you should see somewhere that says “normal”. 
                    If you click on that it will likely open up a list of different layer modes, from then which you can choose from. 
                    The examples above are Photoshop, Krita and Clip Studio Paint from left to right.

            <h2>How does this website work?</h2>

                <img src="Images\halfOpacityDiagram.png" alt="Image showing the effect of fifty percent opacity.">
                <p>Layer modes are largely split up into different categories, with them each doing different things. 
                    This website is split into layer modes that darken, lighten, increase the contrast and other things. 
                    Keep in mind that your art platform will not have all of these, and it may have some layer modes that aren’t on here. These are just some of the most common. 
                    The website will have an example image on the left, and a block of text on the right like this section. 
                    The solid colour is what the layer looks like before it is changed, and the right the bottom image before it affected.
                    The middle strip is the effect of the layer mode on the image. This example is simply at 50% opacity.
