            <!--Explains what layer modes in this catagory do-->
            <h2>What are Darken Modes?</h2>
            <p>Darken modes are all layer mode that will darken the original picture in some way. 
                Some of these do it by selecting the darker colour out of the two layers, and others by combining the channel information. 
            These layer modes are often used to create shadows or a moody atmosphere. One of the most common one of these is the layer mode multiply.</p>

            <!--Multiply layer explained-->
            <h2>Multiply</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\multiplyDiagram.png" alt="Example of multiply layer in use">
                <p>This layer multiplies the top layer by the bottom layer which results in a darker more vibrant tone overall. 
                    This means that the resulting colour is always darker than the original, and tinted with the blend mode as can be seen in the example.
                    An important thing to note is that if the blend mode is black, the final image will be black, and if it is white the final will be unchanged.
                    It is most often used to create shadows on art, due to it both making objects darker and not losing the vibrancy of the piece.Â 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Colour burn layer explained-->
            <h2>Colour Burn</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\colourBurnDiagram.png" alt="Example of colour burn layer in use">
                <p> This darkens the base color to reflect the blend color by increasing the contrast using the different colours in the artwork.
                    This layer mode will make the dark colours in your image darker, and also make the whole image more vibrant. 
                    It is the layer mode that produces the most contrast in this group, and also will preserve the whites on the bottom layer. 
                    This means that any white will be unaffected by the top layer.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Linear burn layer explained-->
            <h2>Linear Burn</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\linearBurnDiagram.png" alt="Example of linear burn layer in use">
                <p> This layer mode looks at the color information in each channel and darkens the base color to reflect the blend color by decreasing the brightness.
                    This means that it darkens shadows a lot and makes the final picture more vibrant, similar to Colour Burn. 
                    However unlike Colour Burn it doesn't keep the light colours as is, darkening them instead of preserving them. 
                    It also has gives less contrast and colour in the final piece that Colour Burn, making it a good mix between colour burn and multiply.
                    <!--It is often used for making dark colours and shadows darker, adding texture to dark colours or deepinging colours. - Unused information -->
                    Something to note is that if the top layer is black, there will be no change to the lower layer.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Darker colour layer explained-->
            <h2>Darker Colour</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\darkerColourDiagram.png" alt="Example of darker colour layer in use">
                <p>Darker Color identifies the overall lower-value color between the two layers and displays it, without creating a third color as opposed to Darken.
                    This means that it focuses on the image as a whole, creating distinct lines between what is shown on the top and bottom layers.
                    This layer mode is good for replacing large blocks of colour with another, or replacing elements such as one sky with a darker one. 
                    The opacity can be lowered for a more subtle effect.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Darken layer explained-->
            <h2>Darken</h2>
            <div class="layer">
                <img src="Images\darkenDiagram.png" alt="Example of darken layer in use">
                <p> Darken compares the luminosity of each channel and selects the darker of the two colors.
                    It opperates on individual channels, which means it has the potential to create a third "blending" colour.
                    It produces a similar effect to darker colour, however with a softer finish with more blending around the edges.
                    This is because it can produce a third colour which is similar to the two if the colours are close enough, creating a softer look than darker colour.
